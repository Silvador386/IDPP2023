### Organisation of the repository ###

The repository is organised as follows:

* `score`: this folder contains the performance scores of the submitted runs.
* `code`: this folder contains the source code of the developed system.
* `resource`: this folder contains any additional resources created during the participation;
* `report`: this folder contains the template for the participant report.

iDPP@CLEF 2023 consists of *three tasks* 

* **Task 1** - Predicting Risk of Disease Worsening (Multiple Sclerosis)
* **Task 2** - Predicting Probability of Worsening (Multiple Sclerosis)
* **Task 3 Position Papers** - Impact of Exposition to Pollutants (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)

Therefore, the `submission` and `score` folders are organized into sub-folders for each task.
